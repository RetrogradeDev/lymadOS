I initialized the project and made a simple "Hello, World!" print to the serial port. It uses a UEFI bootloader and works pretty well so far (we have a wopping 50 lines of code so it would be hard to mess up). Next step is to set up a basic memory management system, refactor the serial driver a bit and find out why rust-analyzer is being weird.
